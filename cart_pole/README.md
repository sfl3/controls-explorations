# Cart Pole

This folder contains a Jupyter notebook `CartPoleExample.ipynb` which calculates cart pole state space equations using `sympy` and then simulates MPC and lQR algorithms. 

As a follow up, there is also a simple visualization using Python Arcade. You can run the visualization by running

```console
$ python3 cart_pole/cart_pole_visualization.py
```
