# Controls Explorations

This repo contains my explorations into various controls and state estimation algorithms. I utilize Jupyter notebooks to provide a blog style explanation of math and code. I plan to explore models and algorithms that inspire me and remind me how cool it is to be a controls engineer.

Feel free to learn along with me!
